# Ringo Radar
Ringo Radar is an app designed to showcase the custom metrics I've been developing over the past few months. The app allows users to generate radar plots featuring six metrics, providing a visual representation of player impact and performance.

For a more detailed explanation of the metrics and how they work, please visit my blog post:
Métricas de Impacto e Ringo Radar: Uma Ferramenta para Auxiliar no Scouting (in Portuguese).

This is my first public project, and I’m excited to keep improving it. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

Thank you for checking it out!
